This repository contains all the ques I solved on the platform CodeChef.<br>
The questions are sorted according to their difficulty level. Right now I am solving ques at the 1000 - 1200 (1* Beginner Level).<br>
This repository is created with the objective that this will motivate me to solve ques on those days when I don't feel like doing anything as well as to increase my problem solving skills.
